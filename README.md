## INTRODUCTION
##### My name is Duola Jin, and I am a graduate student from the School of Software at Zhejiang University. My graduate major is Industrial Design Engineering. My hometown is Changzhou, Jiangsu, which is a very beautiful city. I don't want to go to school at all, I just want to have a vacation. I like to eat, my favorite food is fried chicken, and my favorite software is PPT.
